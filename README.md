# C++ Drills

A collection of coding exercises designed to maintain and strengthen C++ proficiency. These drills focus on core language concepts and patterns essential for advanced topics like CUDA programming.

## Purpose

- **Build consistent coding habits** in C++
- **Reinforce fundamental concepts** required for systems programming
- **Prepare for advanced domains** like GPU computing with CUDA
- **Develop problem-solving skills** through structured exercises

## Structure

Drills are organized by topic, progressing from basics to intermediate concepts:

- Memory management (pointers, references, smart pointers)
- Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)
- Templates and generic programming
- STL containers and algorithms
- Performance optimization techniques
- Concurrency and threading basics

## Getting Started

Each drill includes a problem statement and starter code. Solutions should demonstrate:
- Clean, readable code
- Proper resource management
- Efficient algorithms
- Understanding of C++ idioms

## Goal

Regular practice with these drills ensures readiness for CUDA programming, where deep C++ knowledge is critical for writing high-performance GPU code.
